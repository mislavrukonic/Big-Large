 * the description filed is shown when the user types in the command
 * to initiate the creation of an evet: /schedule
 * 
 * the options field holds all the template fields with which the user will set 
 * arguments. for example, the first option will ask the user to type in a title 
 * for their event, and then they will tab to the next option, etc.
